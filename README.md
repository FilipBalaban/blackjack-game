# blackjack-game
This is my take on Scrimba's blackjack project, in which I added some new features and a new design.
I have added new features like player credits and requirement to draw a new card every time you start a game.

// Rules
You win blackjack if you get the sum of 21
You lose if you cross the sum 21
You can draw a new card if your sum is less than 21

You get 100 credits if you win a blackjack
You get 25 credits if you draw a card that's under the sum of 21
You lose 50 credits if you cross the sum of 21
